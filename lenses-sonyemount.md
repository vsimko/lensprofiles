### SMC Pentax 135mm f/2.5

### Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 24-70mm f/2.8 ZA SSM
This version is for Sony A-Mount (DSLR).
With the *LA-EA3* adapter it can be used on *Sony A7II* and *A7IIR* cameras, since they provide on-chip PDAF.
On my A7II, the focusing is reasonably fast but not as fast as the native *Sony FE 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS* lens with CDAF.
The gap is epecially visible in low light conditions.
However, this is negligible when image quality is a priority.
